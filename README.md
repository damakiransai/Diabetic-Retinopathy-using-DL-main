## 📖 Overview

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes and may lead to blindness if not detected early.  

This project presents a Deep Learning-based system that automatically detects and classifies the severity level of Diabetic Retinopathy using retinal fundus images.

The goal is to assist medical professionals by providing an automated screening tool.
